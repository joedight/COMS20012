# Exercises sheet 1

**Correction after reading week.**

## A. Intro to CIA/AAA/Threat/Security Principles
1. Let us assume tha mayor of Bristol wants to release a public notice on an important issue. Which of the CIA properties should be enforced and why?


2. Explain why someone need not worry about being a victim of a social engineering attack through their cell phone if they are inside of a Faraday cage.


3. With respect to the C.I.A. and A.A.A. concepts, what risks are posed by Trojan horses?


4. With respect to the C.I.A. and A.A.A. concepts, what risks are posed by someone making so many download requests from an online music store that it prevents other users from being able to download any songs?


5. Give an example of the false sense of security that can come from using the “security by obscurity” approach.


6. The HF Corporation has a new refrigerator, the Monitator, which has a camera that takes a picture of the contents of the refrigerator and uploads it to the HF Corporation’s web site. The Monitator’s owner can then access this web site to see what is inside their refrigerator without opening the door. For security reasons, the HF Corporation encrypts this picture using a proprietary algorithm and gives the 4-digit PIN to decrypt this picture to the Monitator’s owner, so he or she can get access to the pictures of their Monitator’s interior. What are the security concerns and principles that this solution does and doesn’t support?


7. Suppose an Internet service provider (ISP) has a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone system that it manages and sells. Suppose further that this ISP is deliberately dropping 25% of the packets used in its competitors VoIP system when those packets are going through this ISP’s routers. Describe how a user could discover that his ISP is doing this.



## B. Intro to Assembly

1. What is WYSINWYX and how it is related to software security?


2. What are memory corruption bugs and what causes them?


3. Can you find one instance where a weakness (not the vulnerability) poses violation to CIA?


4. For a x86-32 ISA, what are `cdecl` and `fastcall` calling conventions?


5. For Intel x86 ISA, consider a function **A** calls another function **B**. We denote base/frame point RBP of **A** (resp. of **B**) as RBP<sub>A</sub> (resp. as RBP<sub>B</sub>). Which of the following holds and why:
	RBP<sub>A</sub> > RBP<sub>B</sub>; RBP<sub>A</sub> < RBP<sub>B</sub>; RBP<sub>A</sub> = RBP<sub>B</sub>.


6. What  is a *saved return address* and why is it used?


7. Which general purpose register is used for return value?


8. Consider the following C code:

		#include <stdio.h>
		int sum(int a, int b)
		{
		    return a+b;
		}

		void main()
		{
		    int n1,n2,n3,n4,x,y, a,b;
		    char some[]="Something";
		    n1 = 10;
		    a = 10;
		    n3 = 10;
		    char some1[]="Something";
		    n2 = 10;
		    b = 10;
		    n4=10;
		    x=sum(n3,n4);
		    y=sum(n1,n2);
		    printf("Sum are: %d and %d", x,y);
		}
And its disassembly as follows:

a. Can you identify in the assembly which memory locations (of the form `-0xN(%ebp)`) correspond to which variables in the main function?



b. . In the C code above, if you compile the code for x86-32 system, at the line `x=sum(n3,n4);`which argument will be pushed onto the stack first?

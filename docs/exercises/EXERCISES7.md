1. Explain what preemptable and non-preemptable mean.


2. What are the three metrics to consider when designing a scheduling policy?


3. Explain FCFS, SJF, SRTF and Round Robin scheduling algorithms.


4. Why SRTF would not be appropriate in a modern system?


5. Explain the CSF scheduling policy.


6. Explain the MLFQ.


7. Why do you think Linux use a red black tree structure to identify the next task to run?


8. We use a MLFQ algorithm with 3 level of priority with Q3=\{T4\}, Q2=\{T1,T2\} Q1=\{T7\}. What thread should be picked next?


9. We use a CFS algorithm. We have three threads such that: T1\{weight=1, aruntime=6\}, T2\{weight=10, aruntime=16\}, T3\{weight=8, aruntime=9\}. Which thread should be picked next?


10. In your opinion, in order to handle multi core scheduling should we use a single queue shared across multiple cores or implement a queue per-core?


11. Could you imagine a better load balancing than the one proposed in OS161? (remain at an abstract level, you do not need to implement it)
